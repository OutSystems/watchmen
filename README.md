watchmen
========

Watchmen is a component for the OutSystems Platform that allows tracking
client-side JavaScript errors and performing actions on them such as
reporting error information to a server or analytics service.

In this repository we make available the original TypeScript source for the
component's JavaScript.

Using with the OutSystems Platform
----------------------------------

The full component is available for download at the [forge][os-forge]. To
install it, download the OSP and publish it in your server.

Using without the OutSystems Platform
-------------------------------------

We don't support this scenario, but feel free to fork the code and adapt it
to your own needs. You'll need to include [stacktrace.js][stacktrace-js] in
which is a dependency.
